# Braid Setup

Braid is distributed as a prebuilt macOS arm64 binary through a Homebrew tap.
One `braid setup` command bootstraps your own GitHub App, persists credentials
outside the repository, and writes a starter configuration.

## Install

```shell
brew install xiaoland/braid/braid
braid --version
```

## Requirements

- macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon).
- [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated with an account
  that can create GitHub Apps for the target owner (user or organization).
- A repository where you will install the App.
- For the Pi provider: a DeepSeek API key exported as `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` (or
  the environment variable configured with `--api-key-environment`) *only at
  setup time*.

## Bootstrap

```shell
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...
braid setup owner/repository --instance <KEY>
```

`--instance` defaults to the repository owner. It is the local name for the
Braid instance and appears in `BRAID_INSTANCE`, the `~/.braid/registry.toml`,
and the `service.instance.id` telemetry attribute.

Options:

- `--provider pi|codex` — defaults to `pi`.
- `--model <MODEL>` — defaults to `deepseek-chat`.
- `--api-key-environment <ENV>` — env var to read the provider API key from
  during setup; defaults to `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`. The key is then persisted into
  the user-level secrets file, so the env var is only needed at setup time.
- `--user-home <DIR>` — defaults to `~/.braid` (or `BRAID_USER_HOME`).
- `--instance <KEY>` — defaults to the repository owner.

`braid setup` performs these steps:

1. Verifies `gh auth` and reads the acting GitHub login.
2. Resolves the Braid user home (`~/.braid` by default) and instance key
   (owner by default).
3. Generates a random webhook secret.
4. Reads the provider API key from the environment variable named by
   `--api-key-environment`.
5. Builds a GitHub App Manifest with the permissions Braid needs
   (`contents:write`, `issues:write`, `pull_requests:write`, `metadata:read`).
6. Starts a temporary local HTTP callback server.
7. Opens a browser to `github.com/settings/apps/new` (or the organization
   variant) with the manifest pre-filled.
8. Captures the browser redirect and exchanges the code for the App's
   private key, slug, and ID.
9. Writes files under `~/.braid`:
   - `registry.toml` — the instance registry (SSoT for `BRAID_INSTANCE`
     resolution).
   - `instances/<key>/config.toml` (schema version 2)
   - `instances/<key>/github-app.pem` (mode `0600`)
   - `instances/<key>/secrets.toml` (mode `0600`) — webhook secret only
   - `secrets/<provider>.toml` (mode `0600`) — provider API key, shared
     across instances for the same provider
   - `instances/<key>/state/` directory for the SQLite database, backups,
     and worktrees.

Using per-instance secrets and a shared user-level provider key means multiple
Braid instances can run on the same machine without colliding on a single
environment variable. `BRAID_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is no longer required.

After setup:

1. Install the App on your repository by visiting the printed install URL.
2. Run diagnostics:

   ```shell
   braid doctor --instance <KEY>
   ```

3. Start Braid with a public tunnel:

   ```shell
   braid serve --instance <KEY> --tunnel
   ```

   See [`tunnel.md`](tunnel.md) for how the tunnel works and why no
   Cloudflare account is required.

The tunnel receives GitHub webhooks and routes them to Braid's local ingress.

## Activating Braid on an Issue

Braid activates through a **trusted `@braid` mention**: a visible `@braid` in
an issue comment from a repository MAINTAIN/ADMIN actor wakes the Issue Agent
(after the Quiet Window). Braid acknowledges the mention with an `eyes`
reaction.

Native Issue assignment is a GitHub-side *Agent App* provisioning (the same
capability that makes Copilot assignable), not a permission an ordinary
GitHub App can hold — an App created through the manifest flow does not
appear in the assignee picker, and assigning it via the API is rejected. If
GitHub ever provisions your App as an Agent App, assignment works without any
configuration change; Braid detects the mode at runtime.

## Provider credentials and source checkout

`braid setup` also prepares the instance-scoped provider home
(`~/.braid/instances/<KEY>/provider/codex`) and the instance source checkout
(`~/.braid/instances/<KEY>/source`): one Git clone of the configured
repository shared by all Profiles. Braid never edits it directly — Agent
sessions run in dedicated generation-scoped worktrees provisioned from it
(`state/worktrees/...`), and each worktree's `.braid/` directory is git-excluded
scratch space the Agent may use freely. Setup clones
the repository automatically; if the clone cannot run, it prints the manual
`git clone` command and `braid doctor` reports the missing checkout.

Codex authenticates per `CODEX_HOME`, and Braid isolates it per instance, so
your global `~/.codex` credentials do not automatically apply. Setup imports
`~/.codex/auth.json` into the instance provider home when it exists; otherwise
authenticate it before serving:

```shell
CODEX_HOME=~/.braid/instances/<KEY>/provider/codex codex login
```

`braid doctor` reports this as the "Codex credentials" check. The Pi provider
needs no home bootstrap: it authenticates with the API key persisted at setup.

## Headless / manual App creation

If you cannot or do not want to open a browser from the terminal, run:

```shell
braid setup owner/repository --no-browser
```

This prints:

- A generated auto-submitting HTML form file; open it in any browser to POST
  the manifest to GitHub.
- A `curl` command that performs the same POST.
- The full manifest JSON for copy-paste creation.
- The install URL for the repository.
- Instructions on how to persist the PEM, secrets file, and config so Braid
  can run.

GitHub expects the manifest as a `POST` form field named `manifest`; a plain
query parameter will not pre-fill the form. The generated HTML file handles this
automatically.

## Notes

- The GitHub App Manifest flow is the supported path for creating Apps
  programmatically; GitHub does not expose a headless API for App creation.
- The generated App logo is saved as
  `~/.braid/instances/<key>/braid-of-<owner>-logo.png`.
- Secrets are split: the webhook secret lives in the instance
  `secrets.toml`; the provider API key lives in `~/.braid/secrets/<provider>.toml`. Both are mode `0600`.
